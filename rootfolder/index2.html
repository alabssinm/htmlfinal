      <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>Basketball is a game played between two teams of five players in whcih goals are scored by throwing the basketball through the netted hoop located above each end of the court. The game of basketball as it is known today was created by Dr. James Naismith in December 1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts, to condition young athletes during cold months. It consisted of peach baskets and a soccer style ball. </p>

    <p>To start playing the game, we need to first gather the equipment. This should be very easy as the game only requires a ball and two hoops perched at a height of ten feet at the opposite ends of a court. It is also a good idea to wear proper basketball shoes, and not any jogging pair while playing. A nice team jersey can be worn when you get better at playing and are part of your school or college team.</p>

    <p>He was raised by his single mother who often did not have sufficient money to pay rent for their residence. So she sent her son to stay with a local football coach who introduced LeBron to basketball at the age of nine. As he was growing up he chose to play for the Northeast Ohio Shooting Stars team. As part of this team LeBron was able to achieve success at both the local and the national level.</p>
