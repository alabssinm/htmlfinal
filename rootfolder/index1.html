<h3> OBJECTIVE </h3>
    <p>Football is a game played between two teams of eleven players where the objective is to get the ball to the other end of the field by either passing or running. There are three total teams: the defense, offense and special teams. The defense defends the opposing team from scoring, while the offense attempts to score. The special teams returns the ball when either the opposing team scores, or the opposing team punts the ball. They also punt the ball for their team and kick field goals. If the offense uses all four downs without gaining ten yards, the ball is turned over to the other team. If the other team catches a ball that has not hit the ground, the ball is turned over to the opposing team. If the offense fumbles the ball and the defense recovers, the ball is turned over to the opposing team.
